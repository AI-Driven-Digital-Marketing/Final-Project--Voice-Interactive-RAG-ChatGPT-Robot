        Introduction: \n
        Mock Interview Robots is a tool that utilizes Open AI API and prompt engineering to offer an immersive interview experience for job seekers.
        Users input a job description and the robot acts as a friendly interviewer, asking specific technical and behavioral questions. With chat API, streamlit, and TTS,
        users can interact with the robot and record their answers, preparing for real interviews.\n
        Technical: \n
        The robot will be engineered initially to set the default role as a friendly interviewer interviewer and integrate previous conversations into its programming.
        Streamlit will capture voice recordings that will be converted to text through whipser and analyzed by the model.
        The model's reply will be translated to voice, generating a realistic simulation of an interview conversation.\n
        Additional data structures(hashmap) are created to seperately store characteristics of robot, conversation history and chat history.
